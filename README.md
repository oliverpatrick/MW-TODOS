# MirrorWeb Todos

## 🎛️ Overview

Welcome to the MirrorWeb Tech Test! We'd like to see how you approach building out a simple full-stack application, as well as how you organise your code for others to follow.

There are two parts to the application - the server (found [here](api/index.ts)), and the UI (found [here](src/app.tsx)). We'd like you to use both to create a simple todo application that's a joy to use!

> 🚨 **Attention!** Please **DON'T** use any libraries other than the ones already installed (e.g. no data fetching or forms libraries) - just React and what the browser gives you.
>
> However, if you know some libraries you feel would enhance the UX of your app and/or make its development easier, this is a great thing to discuss during your interview!

## 🔨 Tasks

As a minimum, we'd like your app to offer the following core features:

1. Viewing a list of todos x
2. Creating new todos x
3. Updating the text existing todos x
4. Toggling a todo between 'active' and 'complete' x
5. Deleting todos x
6. Filter todos by 'active' and 'completed' x

Beyond that, how you implement things and present them is up to you. However, remember to approach things as a real user would - this means thinking not just about the correct way to use the app, but how they may misuse it too...

### ✨ Bonus

Writing some [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) tests for your complete application is a great way to show you've thought about users will interact with your application!

## Notes

- **DON'T** use any libraries other than the ones already installed (e.g. no data fetching or forms libraries) - just React and what the browser gives you. However, if you know libraries you feel would enhance the UX of your app and/or make its development easier, this is a great thing to discuss during your interview!
- For styling, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) supports CSS/SCSS Modules, PostCSS, and plain old CSS out-of-the-box - what you use is up to you. We're not looking for a super app, only enough that it's clear to the user what's happening and the UI interactions/controls are accessible.
- Please endevour to use semantic and accessible HTML markup wherever possible.
